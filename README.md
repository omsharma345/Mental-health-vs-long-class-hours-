# Mental-health-vs-long-class-hours-
This project studies how long class hours affect students' mental health, focusing on stress, sleep, and well-being, and aims to suggest improvements.


# Impact of Long Class Hours on Mental Health

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between extended class hours and the mental health of students. 
Using simulated data and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we examine how academic workload 
affects stress levels, sleep quality, and overall happiness. The aim is to identify patterns 
that can help raise awareness and support healthier academic environments.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and analysis using pandas
- Visualization of trends with seaborn and matplotlib
- Correlation analysis between academic hours and mental health indicators
- Heatmaps and scatter plots for easy data interpretation

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

#ðŸ“Š Data Collection
The dataset used in this project was created based on responses collected through a Google Form survey. 
Students were asked about their average daily class hours, perceived stress levels, sleep duration, 
and overall happiness. The collected responses were organized into a structured format suitable for analysis. 
Although the dataset is relatively small, it provides real-world insights into how academic
schedules affect mental health, serving as a foundation for future, larger-scale studies.

## How to Run
